# BifLib
BifLib is a MATLAB library for generating Basic Image Features (BIFs) from images.

## Introduction to BIFs

BIFs are a classification of local image structure into seven different classes on the basis of approximate local symmetry. 
The seven classes are _flat_, _gradient_, _dark blob_, _light blob_, _dark line_, _light line_ and _saddle_. 

For a detailed explanation of BIFs, see [Using Basic Image Features for Texture Classification](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11263-009-0315-0)
