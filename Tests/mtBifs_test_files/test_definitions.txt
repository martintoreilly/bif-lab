% Test definition line format
% ===========================
% Each test definition line should be 4 comma-separated values as follows. Any 
% additional fields will be silently ignored. Too few fields will cause the test
% to fail with an error.
% 1. Test image filename. Images should be 100x100 pixels. Each feature should 
%    contain a single centralised test feature. Image filenames should not 
%    contain spaces. Images should be stored in the same folder as this file.
% 2. BIF blurWidth parameter (sigma)
% 3. BIF flatnessThreshold parameter (gamma)
% 4. Expected BIF class for central pixel(s) of image.
